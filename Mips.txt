general purpose register 32 , $0, $1, .... $31

arithmetic/logic unit (ALU)
===========================

operand
Machine instructions that use the ALU specify four things:

The operation to perform.
The the first operand (often in a register).
The second operand (often in a register).
The register that receives the result.

word aligned : memory address must be a multiple of four.

也就是说 lw 的下一条指令不能使用 t

sw     t,off(b)      # store word, b is a register. off is 16-bit two's complement.
- address must be word aligned

store halfword

in MIPS , all arithmetic is 32-bit
low-order result not alway correct
These are problems that compilers face and handle it.
so 16-bit arithmetic is much slower that 32-bit sometimes

Before the PC changes, the instruction after the jump instruction has been fetched and executed. The instruction that follows a jump instruction in memory is said to be in the branch delay slot. 
pipelined , pipe
流水线
Often the __branch delay__ slot is filled with a no-op instruction. 

j    target     # after a delay of one machine cycle,
                # PC  <-- address of target

   6              26
000010 00000000000000000000000000    -- fields of the instructuion

opcode         target                -- meaning of the fields

26-bit addr transformed into 32-bit addr

shift left 2bit add high order 4-bit of PC to head

So most jumps are local

block

Rule 1 of Structured Programming: A code block is structured. In flow charting terms, a box with a single entry point and single exit point is structured. 
Rule 2 of Structured Programming: Two or more code blocks in sequence are structured. 
Rule 3 of Structured Programming: The alternation of two code blocks is structured. 
Rule 4 of Structured Programming: The iteration of a code block is structured. 
Rule 5 of Structured Programming: A structure (of any size) that has a single entry point and a single exit point is equivalent to a code block.

- Pseudoinstructions and the pseudocomputer. 
- move   pseudoinstruction. 
- li   pseudoinstruction. 
- la   pseudoinstruction. 
- lw   pseudoinstruction. 
- sw   pseudoinstruction. 
- nop   pseudoinstruction. 

$0 zero Permanently 0  
$24, $25 $t8, $t9 Temporary

$29 $sp Stack Pointer 
$8-$15 $t0-$t7 Temporary
$30 $fp Frame Pointer 
$16-$23 $s0-$s7 Saved registers
$31 $ra Return Address 

Only $0, $31 are different from rest

temporary registers $t0-$t7,$t8, and $t9 and the saved registers
$s0-$s7 are used for local variables  
temporary registers may be changed after a subroutine call
but savad registers not

group:
1.variables and arguments in subroutines ($0, $v0-$v1, $a0-$a3, $t0-$t9,
$s0-$s7), 
2.other
The most fundamental part of an operating system is the kernel. The
kernel contains the most fundamental parts of the OS. The rest of the
OS is mostly implemented using the functions provided by the
kernel. Two registers, $k0 and $k1, are reserved for the
kernel. Applications programs (and most OS subroutines) should not
touch them.  
$gp, $sp, and $fp are base registers used for access to various parts
of memory.


= Pseudoinstructions / 伪指令=

A pseudoinstruction is an instruction that the extended assembler
replaces with one or more basic assembly instructions.

addu $t5,zero,$t7

move d,s        #  copy the contents of 
                #  the source register s
                #  to the destination register d
                #  (pseudoinstruction)

$d <- $s

d, s 可以是助记名称, 也可以是通用寄存器名称.

Load Immediate

li   d,value        #  load register $d with the 
                    #  positive or negative integer
                    #  "value".  Value may be a 
                    #  16 or a 32-bit integer. 
                    #  (pseudoinstruction)
$d <- value

li $v2,-153   ==   addiu $v2,$0,-153
ori 不可使用有符号数字(16 bits)

li $v2,0x12345678      ==     lui $v2,0x1234  
   		             ori $v2,$v2,0x5678  
ori 和 lui 只能操作16位数字
li 将指令自动转换为最有效的操作序列

Load Address

la   d,exp          #  load register $d with the address
                    #  described by the expression "exp"
                    #  "exp" is often a symbolic address
                    #  (pseudoinstruction)

$d <- &exp
储存指针的寄存器保存的是指针. 基址
并不访问内存
使用 lui 和 ori 实现, 操作数为 $1 , $at assembler temporary
assembler temporary register 用于将伪指令转换为汇编指令中间接变量
一些伪指令和汇编指令名称相同, 例如

lw    $t1,exp    #  load value at  address exp

lw    d,exp      #  Load register $d with the value at 
                 #  address exp.  exp can be any
                 #  of several expression types 
                 #  that evaluate to  an address
                 #  (pseudoinstruction) 

$d <- exp

lw $t0,data   ==   lui $1,0x1000
                   lw $8,4($1)

The extended assembler and its pseudoinstructions makes it look like
you are programming a pseudocomputer―a computer system that is richer
in features and more convenient to program than the actual
hardware. (Often this is called a "virtual computer"; but to avoid
confusion I'll say that pseudoinstructions run on the pseudocomputer.)
This idea of implementing a virtual machine on top of another machine
(which may also be virtual) is very important in computer science.
